          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <img src="assets/images/aboutme.jpg" alt="about" class="featured-image" />
          <p>
            As an active student of Computer Engineering at Telkom University, I am deeply immersed in both the theoretical and practical aspects of this dynamic field. My studies emphasize the development of skills in both software and hardware, providing me with a well-rounded understanding of the integral components of technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, my proficiency in these areas is still evolving, but my enthusiasm for learning and my dedication to mastering both domains drive me to continually enhance my knowledge and capabilities. I am committed to exploring advanced concepts and staying abreast of the latest advances to further refine my skills and contribute meaningfully to the field.

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <h3>C Programming</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/c_programming.png" alt="c-langunge" class="featured-image" />
          <p>
            The C language played a vital role in building my foundation in programming. As a low-level language close to the hardware, C taught me fundamental concepts such as memory management, variable allocation, and efficient data structures. By learning C, I gained a deep understanding of how computers work at a more fundamental level, such as how instructions are translated into operations in the CPU and how data is stored in memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, C has a syntax that is often the basis for other modern programming languages. By mastering C, I find it easier and faster to learn other languages such as Python, PHP, and Kotlin, because many of their basic concepts and syntax structures are similar. C has built a strong foundation for me, allowing me to quickly adapt and master other more abstract or specific programming languages without significant difficulty.
          </p>
          <h3>Python</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/python.png" alt="python-language" class="featured-image" />
          <p>
            Python simplifies the process of data analysis with its simple syntax and rich libraries. I can quickly clean, process, and visualize data to find important patterns and trends. This helps a lot in making better data-driven decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, Python is also very useful in machine learning. With libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, I can easily build, train, and test predictive models. This speeds up model development and allows me to get accurate results in the machine learning projects I work on.
          </p>
          <h3>Arduino</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/arduino.png" alt="arduino" class="featured-image" />
          <p>
            My first experience with Arduino launched me into a world of electronics possibilities. This microcontroller board was not only the first tool I used to bring my projects to life, but also a gateway to a deeper understanding of how electronic devices work. With Arduino, I learned programming, sensor control, and basic logic in a hands-on way. Every project I worked on with Arduino gave me a sense of satisfaction and added to my skills in this area, laying a solid foundation for my journey as an electronics developer.
